# Abstract
PeerHub as the name suggests it’s a concept that we came up with and materialized in the form of a forum where your “ Peers ” can meet on a “ Hub” and make their own communities which like-minded people can join. Also, peers can comment on a post in the community as well as reply to the comments made by their peers. People can also choose their favorite communities so that they can see the latest posts and comments on their personal feed. Users will get recommended posts and communities based on their interactions i.e. post likes, the tags and communities they follow. This platform will bring like-minded people together in which they can grow as a whole community, learn new things about their favorite topics and also discuss ongoing things going on in the world of that community. We are using the MVC design pattern for application architecture and REST as the API architectural style.
